- Hello, I'm @champfish, and welcome to my collection of unfinished projects.  
- I’m a PhD student at Northwestern University where I work simulating and fabricating spintronic devices. 
- I have an especial interesting in machine learning/deep learning/whatever the currently favored buzzword for ANNs is. 
- While I've coded in just about everything at least once, I am least frustrated when using SystemVerilog, Python, Java, or JavaScript. 
- If you are interested in talking, you can check out my [website](https://champfish.github.io/), my probably outdated [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-duffee-653411173/), or [email me](mailto:cj.duffee@gmail.com).
